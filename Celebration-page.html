    <h1>Diwali Celebration</h1>

Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is the annual Festival of Lights1. It is held on the darkest night of the Hindu lunar calendar and ushers in new beginnings just before the arrival of the new moon1. The festival gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness2. This festival is as important to Hindus as the Christmas holiday is to Christians2.

Diwali is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Newar Buddhists, although for each faith it marks different historical events and stories3. Nonetheless, the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil3. Over five days, people take part in festive gatherings, fireworks displays, feasts, and prayer4. Celebrants light rows of traditional clay oil lamps outside their homes to symbolize the victory of light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance4.

The specific legends and rituals may vary, but the essence of Diwali remains a celebration of hope, renewal, and the pursuit of spiritual and moral well-being across diverse religious traditions3. It is widely celebrated in India and is observed by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Newar Buddhists around the world1. It is the most important festival of the year in India and for Hindus in particular4. It is celebrated across faiths by more than a billion people in the worldâ€™s most populous nation and the diaspora4.
