    <h1>Diwali - Festival of Lights</h1>

    <p>
        Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is primarily associated with Hinduism, but it is also celebrated by various other religious and cultural communities, including Jainism and Sikhism. Each religious tradition has its own unique significance and stories associated with the celebration of Diwali. Here's a brief overview of how Diwali is observed in Jain, Hindu, and Sikh traditions:
    </p>

    <h2>Hindu Perspective:</h2>

    <h3>Victory of Lord Rama:</h3>
    <p>
        In Hinduism, Diwali commemorates the return of Lord Rama, along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, to Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The people of Ayodhya welcomed them by lighting oil lamps, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness.
    </p>

    <h3>Goddess Lakshmi's Blessings:</h3>
    <p>
        Hindus also worship Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, during Diwali. It is believed that her blessings bring prosperity and good fortune to the household.
    </p>

    <h3>Celebration of Other Deities:</h3>
    <p>
        Diwali is also associated with the worship of other deities, depending on regional traditions. In some regions, it marks the worship of Lord Krishna and his victory over the demon Narakasura.
    </p>

    <h2>Jain Perspective:</h2>

    <h3>Nirvana of Lord Mahavira:</h3>
    <p>
        For Jains, Diwali holds significance as it marks the attainment of Nirvana by Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, on the same day of Diwali. Jains celebrate Diwali as a day of spiritual awakening and enlightenment.
    </p>

    <h3>Reverence for Lord Mahavira:</h3>
    <p>
        Jains engage in prayers, meditation, and religious rituals to honor Lord Mahavira. They also illuminate their homes and surroundings as a symbol of the light of knowledge dispelling spiritual darkness.
    </p>

    <h2>Sikh Perspective:</h2>

    <h3>Guru Hargobind Ji's Release:</h3>
    <p>
        For Sikhs, Diwali is associated with the release of Guru Hargobind Ji, the sixth Sikh Guru, from imprisonment in the Gwalior Fort. The day is known as Bandi Chhor Divas, which translates to "Day of Liberation."
    </p>

    <h3>Harmandir Sahib Illumination:</h3>
    <p>
        Sikhs celebrate by illuminating the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar and other Gurdwaras with lights. The lighting symbolizes the triumph of light over darkness and the importance of religious freedom.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Elements:</h2>

    <h3>Joyful Celebrations:</h3>
    <p>
        Across these religions, Diwali is a time for joy, festivities, and spending time with family and friends. People decorate their homes, exchange gifts, and share sweets as expressions of love and goodwill.
    </p>

    <h3>Symbolism of Light:</h3>
    <p>
        The common thread in all these traditions is the symbolism of light, representing the victory of righteousness over ignorance and the triumph of good over evil.
    </p>

    <p>
        While the specific legends and rituals may vary, the essence of Diwali remains a celebration of hope, renewal, and the pursuit of spiritual and moral well-being across diverse religious traditions.
